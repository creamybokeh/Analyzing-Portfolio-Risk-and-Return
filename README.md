## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.
The Pandas, pathlib and numpy libraries were used along with matplotlib and must be installed in order to run the program correctly.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.
Pathlib allows the import of files, in this case CSV data.
Numpy is a package that allows for scientific computing and array handling.
Matplotlib allows for the visualization of data in the form of plots and graphs.

This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The user will need to run the program in a code editor such as Juypter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

Documentation for the Pandas library can be found [here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Documentation for the pathlib library can be found[here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

Documentation for the Numpy library can be found [here.](https://numpy.org/doc/1.23/user/index.html)

Documentation for matplotlib can be found [here.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index)
